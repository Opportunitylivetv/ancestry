§ 1824 notes Marshalsea debtor's prison
source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens#Early_years
note: The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means, {dickens_john_1785:kf} was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors' prison in Southwark, London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. {dickens_charles_john_huffam_1812:kx}, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.
note: On Sundays—with his sister {dickens_frances_elizabeth_1810:k}, free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music—{dickens_charles_john_huffam_1812:kx} spent the day at the Marshalsea. He later used the prison as a setting in Little Dorrit. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking.

§ 1841 background Social setting
source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens
note: At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as sanitation and the workhouse—but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in Hard Times (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed "Hands" by the factory owners; that is, not really "people" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression.

source: Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens#Last_years
note: On 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for Our Mutual Friend, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.
